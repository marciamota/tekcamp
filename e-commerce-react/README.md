There is a bug in chrome inspect page when you open localhost:3000. If you open inspect to inspect any header you may find the page flickering, this is not a code bug but chrome bug, you can open in firefox without any issues. If you want to use chrome just go to products page and hit reload > empty cache and Hard Reload.
