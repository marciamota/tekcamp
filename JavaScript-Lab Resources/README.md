## Title
Javascript Second Exercise - Form Validation Project

### Tasks
Receive an error message when the “form” is submitted if:
▪ Any “input” field is empty. The message for this error should say:
• "[Field Name] cannot be empty."
▪ The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should
have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say:
• "Looks like this is not a valid email"
